# Segment-Display-Recognition-Neural-Network
Created a neural netowork from scratch by following along with Linkedin Learning's "Training Neural Networks in C++".

Used a feedforward neural network with 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, and, 1 output layer.

Although a segment display can be easily classified using hard code, the advantage of using a neural network is generability espeically when the GUI allows for dimmable sections.
